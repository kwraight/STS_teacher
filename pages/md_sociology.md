### A Path to Sociology

What is the practice/culture/activity of science?
 * what do the people involved Science actually do?

More questions:
* What part of it is unique to things called Science?
     * Can this be used for demarcation
* Is it universal across all Sciences?
     * Are different practices appropriate for different contexts (pluralism)?
* Can it be replicated or removed?
     * How can new subjects join or be dismissed?

These questions raise issues involving
 * _activity_ of science – not (just) written histories of theories
 * _authorities_ in science – who makes the decisions

This is an __empirical__ task - not analytical

This is the task taken up by Science and Technology Studies

### Science and Technology Studies

Lots of (sub-)subjects may fall under the banner of STS. Three are relevant here here:

__Philosophy__
Traditionally a normative study: recommends how things should be

__Sociology__
Traditionally a descriptive study: describes how things are

__History__
Resource of lessons and examples: provides fuel for theories of science

__NB__ Critique doesn’t have to be critical: this isn’t anti-science!
 * Cf. film reviews, sports commentary, political pundits

Reality Check
 * we have now moved away from searching for a _method_ of Science to investigating the _practice_ of scientists 
 * can the practice illuminate the source of _ontological authority_ in society?


### "Old School" Sociology

During the 20th century scholars investigated human organisations including Religion, Health, Crime and ... Science

Original Sociological Studies of Science conducted by Merton:
 * __Institutional environment__: university/laboratory/political climate
     * Effects on rate of progress of science, but not on substance
 * __Norms__: guiding principles to scientific activity
     * _communism_: sharing knowledge through published results
     * _universalism_: impersonal criteria of evaluation
     * _disinterestedness_: exclude personal interest
     * _organised scepticism_: (internal) criticism encouraged

    alt="disciplinary cloud"
    width="125" height="200"/>

By the 1970s this approach was out of fashion
 * Limited studies to static Scientists (bodies in rooms)
 * Ignored content of Science (theory and practice)

> [Previous studies] exhibit an excessive respect, bordering on pious reverence for scientific facts. - Ludwig Fleck


### Error Analysis

Interest in practitioners of Science has been around for a long time 
 * but old stories about Scientific failure tend to focus on individuals

This was termed __Sociology of Scientific Error__: where people only matter when something breaks

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/sociology/errors.png"
    alt="errors"
    width="1000" height="100"/>

Historical examples were used to supply anecdotes with pedagogical use:
 * Just-so stories providing explanation for a practice/behaviour
    * e.g. Kepler and the motions of the planets
    * ignore unfashionable reasoning is removed
 * Morals and Fables on how to be a good scientist
     * e.g. Nweton standing on the shoulders of giants 
     * ignore personal faults of "heroes"
 * Cautionary tales of mistakes with celebrated solutions
     * e.g. the unnecessary Ether
     * ignore historical order of experiments and theory development

These are __not__ empirical investigations of the practice of Science


### The "New School"

The “New” Sociological Studies of Science (cf. 1960s+) wanted to go beyond the macro-sociological studies and investigate micro-sociological detail
 * oving from studies of Scientific _institutions_ to the _practice_ of Science 

They did not accept the Norms/Values Scientists ascribed themselves
 * the point of the empirical study is find out what happens in practice

Part of the practice of Science is _deciding_ Scientific facts, i.e. the content of Science
 * part of the “New” school was the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK), i.e. how facts are decided

Critics argued this would lead to sociologists doing bad Science
 * it’s not a sociologist’s place to decide facts of Physics

Sociologists argued they were not interested in the outcome of Scientific debates, but rather how the decisions were made
 * they also complained scientists had been doing bad sociology for years with the Sociology of Scientific Error


### Sociology of Scientific Knowledge

_Sociology of Scientific Knowledge_ (SSK) was interested in how Scientific facts came to be recognised

Various approaches:
* Edinburgh/Bath school’s __Strong Program__ introduced _methodological relativism_
    *explanation of success/failure cannot rely on retrospective “truth” of a theory

* Andrew Pickering ficussed on _contingency_ and _emergence_ in development
    * if people hadn’t made certain decisions or accidents then the theories would have been different

* Bruno Latour and the Paris school developed __Actor-Network Theory__
     * reject theory-laden language to describe science: e.g. abandon distinctions between natural/social, actor/object

These are __not__ arguments about how to _do_ Science

These are arguments about how to _describe_/_understand_ Science

### Taking a Moment

Sociology of Scientific Error: people only matter when something breaks
* Just-so stories: Untestable explanation for a practice/behaviour
* Morals and Fables: How to be a good scientist
* Cautionary tales: Illuminating mistakes with celebrated solutions

During your time as a student of Physics/Science what role have people played in the stories: 
 * heroes overcoming adversity
 * fools hampering progress
 * geniuses enabling leaps foward

## The Science Wars

By the 1990s Scientists were starting take notice of some of the studies of Science:
 * Historians talking about science: Leviathan and the Air-pump
 * Philosophers talking about science: Structure of Scientific Revolutions
 * Sociologists talking about science: Laboratory Life
 * And many others from gender studies, social theory, economists, religious figures

Most scientists didn’t know/care, but some decided to “defend” science from attack – self-styled "_Guardians of Science_"
 * sides were mixed but the _Guardians_ were mostly physicists
 * the spat began in academia and expanded into newspaper articles

The disagreement mostly took the form of polemics with a poor standard of academic debate
 * arguments focussed on philosophical “sticking points”
 * rarely were philosophers involved
 * rarely were previous iterations cited - ignoring 2000+ years of debate

### Post Match Analysis

Hacking’s analysis of the "Sticking Points" at issue:
 1. _Contingency_ of Scientific Knowledge: Could Science look different? 
     * If so, how different?
     * Could the content of scientific theories be different?
 2. _Nominalism_: What is the status of Scientific facts, laws, etc.
     * Objective representation of the world, organisation of phenomena, useful rules for application?
 3. _Stability_: In what sense is science stable as it develops
     * Changes driven by internal factors alone or external factors?
     * Is Science a continuous line of progress or a series of Paradigms?

The arguments were generally not well conducted and the loudest voices were often least measured
 * Lynch commented: two sides of trained experts arguing beyond their expertise (Lynch)

The fever of the debate peaked with __The Sokal Affair__
 * As close as you can get to fame/infamy in STS

### Sokal Affair in Brief

Actors
 * NYU physics professor Alan Sokal
 * Academic journal (postmodern cultural studies) Social Text
 * Academic magazine Lingua Franca

Events
 * Sokal wrote a paper published in Social Text: "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity”
     * summary: Quantum gravity is a social and linguistic construct
* a few weeks later Sokal told Lingua Franca the paper was a hoax(!)

Issues
 * Sokal claimed he wanted to see if he could 
 > “publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions”
 * Critics said he broke the conventions of academia and showed nothing other than contempt for the goodwill of the journal

Outcome
 * sympathists (mostly physicists) sniggered
 * antagonists shook their heads
 * outsiders were bewildered

Some efforts were made in the aftermath to bridge the devide between Scientists and those in Science and Technology Studies and a truce was called
 * relations are cordial at best

### Take a Moment

What do you think about these issues: 
 1. Contingency of Scientific Knowledge: Could Science look different? 
 2. Nominalism: What is the status of Scientific facts, laws, etc.
 3. Stability: In what sense is science stable as it develops

Your reaction will depend on your attitude to Science

## Post-Script

_Some_ bits missed out
* there's much more!


### Post-Normal Science

Beyond foundational debate with a focus on Science in action in society

Move away from isolated problem-solving experts to groups of interested parties
 * participation of extended peer community: scientists, scholars, industrialists, journalists, campaigners, policy-makers, non-specialist citizens
 * scientific certainty is replaced by extended dialogue across society of risks and benefits
 * “Hard facts” replaced by “extended facts” including published results, extended experiences, local surveys and unofficial scientific information 
 * Organising principle of Quality rather than Truth
 * Primacy of Scientific authority replaced by legitimacy of different perspectives from those
