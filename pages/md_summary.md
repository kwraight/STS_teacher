## A Meta-for Science

You may have an (implicit) image of Science that guides your thinking on STS issues: _Contingency_, _Nominalism_, _Stability_ 
 * a principle that guides you but is not necessarily testable

What’s your metaphor of Science/Reality?
 * __Jigsaw Picture__ (e.g. strong realist)
     * Topics as pieces
     * Discrete pieces fit together
     * Goal: full, accurate picture of reality
* __Mesh of theories__ (e.g. weak realist, structuralist)
     * Topics as regions
     * Some parts more detailed than others
     * Goal: comprehensive as possible, coherent, fine mesh
* _Cloud of theories and practices_ (e.g. instrumentalist, irrealist)
     * Diffuse, loosely ordered
     * Goal: use as required

### Implications of Imagery

A strong _realist_ image of Science provides the _epistemic privelege_ to justify a lofty position in society

However this comes with _authoritative_ roles:
 * Authority of definition
     * What counts as (Scientific) Knowledge
 * Authority of policing
     * Defining boundaries of (Scientific) Knowledge
     * Defining quality of (Scientific) Knowledge
 * Authority over dissent
     * What counts as legitimate criticism? 
     * Who gets to criticise?

Combined with an idea of exceptionalism authority becomes a monopoly
* the only real knowledge is Scientific knowledge

STS aims to get beyond the metaphor and to what Scientists _do_


### Back to Knowledge

Steps to Scientific Knowledge

There is a long history of attempts to ground authority of Science in this way
 * focus on _empiricism_ to justify authority 
	e.g. Inductivism, Hypothetico-Deductive method, …

Critics argue in these methods _empiricism_ is mixed with _metaphysics_
Cf. criticisms of Hume, Goodman, Hempel, Popper, Kuhn

This is a problem when Science is conceived as only an _empirical_ method
 * worse when a single (_realist)_ view is the measure of all views

An alternative is to see _metaphysics_ as intrinsic part of Science 
 * principles of inference, practices with data, values of theory comparison


### Mixing Metafors

Identifying Science as solely empirical knowledge is like marketing whisky as wheat-based nutrition
 * there is some truth to it but it’s missing much of the interesting features

To extend the metaphor further..

Empiricism is part of a healthy knowledge diet: look to the world!

__But__ an Empiricism only diet is malnutrition
 * make sure to get your metaphysics: the guiding principles to help inference from experience along


### Beyond Only Empiricism

What are the implications if the focus on empiricism is diminished?
 * Depends on how fixed the view of science is
 * Change of view: trees $\rightarrrow$ woods

Unbiased: Based on observed data, not innate prejudice
 * $\rightarrow$ Bias cannot be expelled but it can be shared

Objective: Based on public data, not subjective opinion
 * $\rightarrow$ Commonly held (inter-subjective) experience

Cumulative: Based on growing data, improves over time
 * $\rightarrow$ Cumulative but in context, and we live in context

Autonomous: Based on internal data, not external influences
 * $\rightarrow$ Nothing is autonomous, and that’s OK

This is not an overhaul of Scientific _practice_; this is a change in perspective
 * No longer about interrogating a singular nature
 * Now about __shared__ agreement, __common__ understanding and __context__ of (Scientific) knowledge
