## A Path to Philosophy

What is the recipe/algorithm/logic of scientific knowledge
 * Progressing from particular experience to general knowledge

More questions:
* Is the method sufficient or necessary?
     * Can it be used for demarcation?
* Is it universal across all sciences?
     * Are different methods appropriate for different contexts (pluralism)?
* Can it be replicated?
     * Can old/other subjects be made scientific?

These questions raise issues involving: 
 * _characteristics_ of science - not just listing sciences 
 * _quality_ of science - grading knowledge

This is an __analytic__ task - not empirical

This is the task taken up by Philosophy of Science

## A Brief History of Philosophy of Science

Philosophy and Philosophy of Science go way back
 * Term scientist only coined ~1833 by William Whewell
 * But many of the old heroes of modern science (especially physics) thought of themselves as Natural Philosophers

Philosophy about Nature (Natural Philosophy) goes back as far as Philosophy
 * Separation of subjects is relatively modern in the history of ideas

Eventually the empirical part of the New Science (ca. 18th century) became more emphasised and popular until (empirical) Science diverged
 * Seen again with Economics and Psychology later on
 * After people continued as philosophers or scientists (though exceptions)

Up until the 20th century Philosophy of Science was mostly:
 a. Part of wider philosophical investigations of knowledge (epistemology)
 b. A hobby for retired scientists

Things change in 20th century as scientific successes boomed


### Deductive Inference

Once upon a time, the best method to knowledge was _deduction_

     alt="not Sherlock"
     width="200" height="200"/>

Steps of inference with certainty
 * Each move as justified as the last (conserving)
 * Validity: impossible for premises true and conclusion false

For example:
 * P1: All humans are mammals
 > $P1: \forall x, Hx \Rightarrow Mx, x \in P$
 * P2: Socrates is a human
 > $P2: Hx$
 * C: Socrates is a mammal
 > $C: Mx$

Rules like _"All Xs are..."_ denote a collection of individual facts
 * like a list: $(Ha \land Ma), (Hb \land Mb), ..., (Hs \land Ms), ...$
 * the conclusion is already in the premise (in the list)

There is no _new_ information
 * though possibly you realise something you had not before

### Classical Science

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/non_amp.png"
     alt="Non-amplicative"
     width="200" height="200"/>

Deductive reasoning is strong but limited
 * A non-amplicative tool of mathematical inference
 * Limited use in empirical setting (and life!)

Where’s the empirical bit?
 * Collecting data

After a formula/rule is used to order the collection
 * There is no rule for predictions beyond data

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/aristotle_statue.png"
    alt="Old order"
    width="200" height="250"/>

Aristotelian view of science
 * Ordering of information according to some ideal scheme
 * Not necessarily empirical

__But__ this doesn't meet the modern expectation of new knowledge

It’s not that this isn't useful, but it isn't the whole story of modern science
 * Of course, collecting data is a big part of science
 * But scientists do more than just tell us about last week

## Take a Moment

Science clearly does have an ordering aspect to it

Some patterns seem obvious in data, others can take years to fathom


Ernst Rutherford, is attributed the quote: 
> All science is either physics or stamp collecting
 * i.e. there’s a distinction here between putting things in order and doing something _physicsy_ (read as _especially sciency_)
 * This is an example of _imperialism_ in physics

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/stamp_collecting.png"
    alt="Stamp collecting"
    width="500" height="200"/>

## Knowledge and Observation

Modern Philosophy of Science has two contrasting approaches of analysis
 * Key difference lies in where experience plays a role

__Induction__

This approach goes back to beginning of modern era (Bacon ca. C17th)

From observation to theory:
 * Begin with data
 * Identify regularities/patterns/correlations
 * Characterise in law 

__Hypothetico-Deduction__

This apporach came to the fore in the twentieth century 

To observation from theory:
 * Generate hypothesis of regularities/patterns/correlations
 * Predict novel phenomenon by deduction
 * Test prediction

Each emphasises _empirical_ input but in different parts of method


### Inductive Inference

Deductive inference is robust but often uninteresting
* Inferring _new_ information is more exciting & useful
* Amplicative inference goes beyond _existing_ infromation

Standard example:
 - P1: all observed frogs are green
 > $P1: \forall x, Fx \Rightarrow Gx, x \in S$
 - P2: all frogs are green
 > $P2: \forall x, Fx \Rightarrow Gx, x \in S'$
 - P3: there is a (new) frog
 > $P3: Fz, z \in S'$
 - C: the (new) frog is green
 > $C: Gz$

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/swans_venn.png"
    alt="Venn diagram"
    width="200" height="200"/>

The step form _P1_ to _P2_ is an _inductive_ leap
 * The law goes beyond the data collected
 * An inference is made to something yet to be observed

_C_ is deduction from _P2_ and _P3_

There is an asymmetry to inductive arguments
 * one counter-example defeats _all_ corroborations 

Any uncertinity in the inductive leap is the price of the ambition
 * (aside: who decides the basic observations anyway?)

    alt="Black swan"
    width="200" height="150"/>


### Varieties of Inference

However, Inductive reasoning is very common and comes in various forms:
__Enumerative induction__: predicting further event(s)
 * Suppose there are examples of some regularity, e.g. 
 > All ravens so far seen are black  
 * Two interpretations:
     1. Weak: _the next_ raven seen will be black
     2. Strong: _all_ ravens are black

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/black_raven.jpg"
    alt="Black raven"
    width="200" height="200"/>

__Eliminative induction__: finding a common cause
 * Contrast where the phenomena was seen and not seen, e.g. 
 > I am grumpy when hungry, I’m happy when fed. Therefore food keeps me happy

__Analogical Induction__: from (observed) properties to others (unobserved)
 * Sets of properties are known to be shared so more are expected, e.g
  > Irn-Bru looks orange so it should taste citrusy

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/irn_bru.jpg"
    alt="Irn-Bru"
    width="150" height="150"/>

Each variety assumes _The Principle of Uniformity of Nature_
 * This expects unobserved things will be like observed things


### Riddles of Induction - Part 1

This (_old_) Riddle of Induction comes form David Hume (1711-1776)

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/hume_portrait.jpg"
    alt="David Hume"
    width="200" height="150"/>

Hume's riddle is a critique of _The Principle of Uniformity of Nature_ (PUN) as not an _empirical_ principle

Cosider the inference:
 * P1: Many observations: e.g. 99 ravens are black 
 * P2: PUN
 * P3: There’s another (new) raven
 * C: It will be black

How do we know _PUN_ is justified?
 * does our confidence come from previous examples

Try another inference: 
 * P1: Previous uses of PUN has worked well
 * P2: PUN
 * P3: New case of PUN
 * C: The new PUN case will work well

Induction is used to justify induction (a.k.a. question begging)
 * PUN worked yesterday therefore PUN will work tomorrow

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/hume_statue.jpg"
    alt="Black raven"
    width="150" height="200"/>

Hence, Hume's criticism
> _The Principle of Uniformity of Nature_ is __not__ an empirical principle


### Riddles of Induction - Part 2

This (_new_) Riddle of Induction is from Nelson Goodman (1906-1998)

Goodman's riddel points out a propensity for a particular kind of Scientific knowledge

Consider Scientific laws have the form: 
 > All Xs are G

But not everything of this form is a law, e.g. All Beatles were Scouse
 * this is considered an _accident_ rather than a _law_

Goodman probes this the form of laws:
 * Suppose a property __grue__ which means: 
 > _green_ until 2050 and _blue_ after 2050

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/grue_gems.png"
    alt="Grue gem"
    width="600" height="150"/>

Therefore:
 * All emeralds are _green_
 * All emeralds are _grue_

Which of these should be considered a reasonable law? 

Relatedly, is _grue_ a reasonable property?

Goodman considered the intuition that laws referring to _"natural"_ properties
 * _grue_ does not look _"natural"_ due to _time dependence_

Goodman redefines _green_
 > _grue_ until 2050 and _bleen_ after 2050
 * All properties can be defined in this _"unnatural"_ way

So, where does the intuition for _"natural"_ properties come form?
 * (aside: who gets to decide what’s natural?)

Hence, Goodman's observation:
 > Property & law definitions involves _non-empirical_ principles


### Riddle Summary

Hume’s and Goodman’s riddles are used to show that induction alone is not the whole story of _The Scientific Method_

Other principles are required to make the _"right"_ kinds of induction
 * The charge is that these principles are __not__ found _empirically_

It criticism is not that these principles are not useful, or that such inferential tools are not used in Science (and in general)
 * Of course, we assume some _uniformity in nature_
 * Of course, we make use of laws with reference to _atemporal_ properties

The criticism is that _induction_ is not the special _empirical_ ingredient that sepeerates Science from other human activities
* Question remains: How do we know when to make assumptions?

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/newton_portrait.png"
    alt="Apparently unframed image"
    width="200" height="200"/>

Newton claimed to not require hypotheses: Hypotheses non fingo
 * data alone is enough to produce knowledge

This crticisim suggests some hypotheses or principles are _required_ to get 
_inducive inferences_ to work

    alt="Textile wisdom"
    width="150" height="200"/>

Arguments from resemblance are extremely powerful:
 * Induction expands your understandable world
 * Elimination helps fix praise/blame to phenomena
 * Analogies make the unfamiliar more familiar
 
 But beware...

## Hypothetico-Deductive Model

Seems difficult to describe rational theory development, e.g. _induction_
 * it's difficult to explain what principles are accetable

Let’s park it! - question for another day / who cares?

New strategy: separate invention from justification
 * Theories can come from any inspiration
 * What counts is testing by experience, a.k.a. _empirical arbitration_ by Nature 
     * empirical bit!

Breaking down the title:
 * __Hypothetico__
     * Come up with a hypothesis, any way you like
 * __Deduction__
     * Deduce the consequences, especially _novel_ phenomena

The emphasis on _novel_ phenomena introduces a a distiction:
 * Consistency test (easy): Can it account for known phenomena?
 * Novel test: Can it predict a new phenomenon? (Verificationism)

The Hypothetic0-Diecutive (HD) model sees the goal of Science as constructing tests of hypothesis based on novel prediction

The outcome of tests is two-fold:
 * Pass – _confirmation_/_corroboration_
 * Fail - _falsification_


### _Confirmationism_ and Hempel's Paradox

Hempel (1905-1997) worked on a _confirmationist_ approach to Science
 * Scientific Knowledge comes form _confirmed_ theories
 * More evidence is more certain

Hempel developed the paradox to critise his own approach

Consider a testable hypothesis: 
 > All ravens are black

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/another_raven.png"
    alt="More ravens"
    width="200" height="200"/>

Intuitively each observation raises belief/confidence

What about _non-ravens_?
 * All raven-things are black-things is _logically equivalent_ to All non-black things are non-raven-things
 > $(\forall x, Rx\Rightarrow Bx) \Leftrightarrow (\forall x, \lnot Bx \Rightarrow \lnot Rx)$
 * Therefore, any thing which is not black and not a raven is a confirmation
     * e.g. my shoe (or your shoe (if it’s not black))

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/shoe_evidence.png"
    alt="Evidence?"
    width="250" height="150"/>

Again, it’s not that _confirmation_ model is ridiculous, but it's not the story we were after
 * It doesn’t reflect how Scientists actually reason
 * It doesn’t justify confidence in a Scientific Method


### Falsificatism

Problems of _confirmation_ are not easily solved
 * _logical equivalence_ makes too many things seem _relevant_
 * not easy to find an adequate definition of _relevance_
     * too many things get included or excluded

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/popper_photo.png"
    alt="Popper"
    width="150" height="200"/>

Popper’s insight was to flip the problem:
 * Science is __not__ a method of _confirmation_
 * Science is a method of _falsification_

He argued there is no _confirmation_ in Science
 * there no _epistmeic justification_ for individual Scientific theories

Instead there is _corroboration_
 * agreement with prediction is not proof and has little (epistemic) value

Theories __cannot__ be proved, but they can be _refuted_
 * a failure in prediction defeats a theory
 * certainty in failure is better than no certainty at all

Popper re-casts confidence in Science and Scientific Knowledge as a confidence in getting rid of refuted theories
 * only _corrobarated_ theories are retained

Hence, Popper's _falsificationist_ view of the Scientific method remains a method of _progress_
 * over time only well-corroborated theories will remain

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/progress_bar.png"
    alt="Progressive?"
    width="200" height="200"/>

__Bonus__: Popper provides a principle of _demarcation_
 * a theory without _falsification_ (at least in principle) is not scientific
 * e.g.: astronomy in; astrology, Marxism, psycho-analysis out


### Falsificationism $^{2}$

Popper saw in the history of science shows several examples where defeated theories can continued to be used after _falsifcation_
 * replacements for refuted theories are required before theories are dismissed
     * e.g. Classical Physics refuted before advent of Quantum Mechanics
 * the _utility_ of a theory may encourage persistence even where (non-refuted) alternatives exist
     * e.g. Newtonian physics still goes far in much of terrestrial engineering - Relativity is not required

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/lift_off.png"
    alt="Newtonian"
    width="150" height="200"/>

Does this falsify Falsificationism?
 * Popper gave more details and argued _falsificationism_ would still work

Some issues remained:
 * What about cases where rival theories can both explain and predict equivalently? - e.g. Copenhagen QM and Bohm’s model
     * Both had equivalent empirical accuracy
     * Does the first theory win by timing alone?
 * Are there other criteria, e.g. simplicity, utility, legacy to help choose between rivals?
    * is _empirical accuracy_ just one of many desirable traits?

## Philsophy of Science re-cap

The story so far…

Looking for a uniquely _empirical_ element in Science to justify high status
 * _ontological authority_ from _epistemic privilege_
 * _deduction_ does not do enough: need _amplicative inference_

__Inductivism__ is amplicative but not the whole story
 * empirical element in gathering data to contruct inferences from
 * need additional principles to read data and guide inferences
 * some reason to think these are not empirical

__Hypothetico-Deductive__ method moves empirical aspect to testing
 * invention of a theory is separate from _justification_
 * _confirmationism_ has problems in how to deal with trivial agreement
 * _falsificationism_ has values agreement (i.e. corroberation) but no guarantee of accuracy
     * use falsification as a guide for progress
     * get demarcation principle back

Ok, some questions remain but at least there’s still progress right _... right_?

## Post-Script

_Some_ bits missed out
* there's much more!

### Vienna Circle

The Vienna Circle was an influential group of (German speaking) academics
 * scientists interested in philosophy and philosophers interested in science

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/philosophy/vienna_room.jpg"
    alt="Viena meeting"
    width="150" height="200"/>

The group existed for ~10 years during the inter-war period with a _Modernist_ agenda to reform philosophy (of Science) known as _Logical Positivism_
 * Exclusive focus on _empirical_ character of science
 * Reject previous thought – theology, meta-physics, non-empirical theories
 * Recast philosophy as meta-subject – role to decide what kind of statements are scientific/non-scientific (sensible/non-sensible), rather than contribute new knowledge

Before World War II most of the (Jewish and Leftist) group fled to UK & USA
 * This had a huge impact on Anglophone philosophical tradition
 * Contributing to _Analytical_ / _Continental_ branching in philosophy

The group had a big influence on the next generation of philosophers of science, including Quine and Kuhn
