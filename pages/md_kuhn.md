## The Twist in the Tale

> [P]hilosophers of science and historians of ideas would like to avoid the world of the laboratory, that repugnant kitchen in which concepts are smothered with trivia - Bruno Latour

The story so far...

Looking for a uniquely _empirical_ element in Science to justify high status
 * _ontological authority_ from _epistemic privilege_
 * _deduction_ does not do enough: need _amplicative inference_

__Inductivism__ is amplicative but not the whole story
 * empirical element in gathering data to contruct inferences from
 * need additional principles to read data and guide inferences
 * some reason to think these are not empirical

__Hypothetico-Deductive__ method moves empirical aspect to testing
 * invention of a theory is separate from _justification_
 * _confirmationism_ has problems in how to deal with trivial agreement
 * _falsificationism_ has values agreement (i.e. corroberation) but no guarantee of accuracy
     * use falsification as a guide for progress
     * get demarcation principle back

At this point _empiricism_ seemed a potential justification for _authority_ of Science
 * but then...

 ### Issues in Observation & Theory

The worries of two philosophers from earlier in the twentieth centuary returned

The warned about any empirical connection between observation and theory

__Pierre Duhem__:

When experiment and theory disagree, there are always alternative sources of blame
 * Experiments do not test a single theory in isolation
 * Many auxiliary theories are included: apparatus, analysis, context

__Willard Van Orman Quine__:

As a point of logic, you can always add extra information so long as the observation is not contradicted
 * The result of any experiment has (logically) an infinite number of interpretations

This is now known as the __Duhem-Quine thesis__:
Theoretical knowledge is _underdetermined_ by experimental observation
 * Additional information is required: background theories, preferences
 * Difficult to demarcate a priori when this is acceptable science or not


### Developing Duhem-Quine Thesis

Modern studies of science flesh out Duhem-Quine in practice to include distinctions
 * Theoretical hypotheses: main/auxiliary hypotheses, principles of inference
 * Phenomenology: techniques of transforming theory to prediction
 * Apparatus: data-taking machinery 
 * Analysis: techniques transforming “raw” data to measurement

This entails the reaction to an experimental results is not determined
 * disconfirmation/falsification of a theory can be avoided by changing/blaming any of the above elements

For example: _often_ students do not make measurements which are compatible with theoretical predictions in the laboratory
 * how many times has V=IR been violated? But Ohm is not in trouble
 * there are many _reasonable_ alternatives to a rejection of theory

Some principles are required to deal with the vast range of possible interpretations
 * the criticism is that these these are not empirically deduced


### Paradigms

Kuhn moved analysis of Science away from describing how an _ideal_ Science might work and on to the actual _History of Science_

For Kuhn, Science consists of sets of hypotheses used to solve problems
 * he called the set of hypotheses _Paradigms_
     * e.g. Copernican solar system, Quantum Mechanics
 * a _Paradigm_ includes theories to make empirical predictions and the required assumptions stated or implicit in the theories
     * e.g. Schrödinger equations and wave-particle duality
 * a _Paradigm_ also includes unspecified practices (perhaps now lost in history)
     * e.g. how to build, calibrate and operate a sextant

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/kuhn/anomaly.png"
    alt="anomoly"
    width="150" height="200"/>

Anomalies arise when data doesn’t fit the predictions __but__ anomalies don’t necessarily end (_falsify_) the paradigm
 * several strategies are available to keep hypotheses
     * dismiss test / change auxiliary hypotheses / adapt central theory

Kuhn argued history shows paradigms change when
 - _too many_ anomalies build and inspire new ways to solve problems
 - there is _no rule_ to predict when people change Paradigm
 - Scientists _at the time_ will find a way to decide winner between competitors


### Points of View

A Paradigm will have ways of obtaining, arranging, analysing data according to theory and practice

There is no guarantee observations are respected across Paradigms
 * Revolution for Kuhn is a big thing – comparable to gestalt shift

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/kuhn/duck_rabbit.jpg"
    alt="duck-rabbit"
    width="300" height="200"/>

Some criteria to compare paradigms:
 * _Predictive Accuracy_: do the theoretical predictions and experiemental results agree (well)
 * _Consistency_: are the varoius sub theories of the paradigm in agreement or are there some clashes
 * _Scope_: how wideranging is the phenomena covered by the paradigm
 * _Simplicity_: not a simple criterion
     * _ontological_ - how many _kinds_ of objects are required
     * _formal_: - how many mathematical tools
 * _Fruitlessness_: how many avenues of development are open

> I am suggesting, of course, that the criteria of choice with which I began function not as rules, which determine choice, but as values, which influence it. - Thomas Kuhn

A lack of fixed rules to compare paradigms by is called _incommensurability_
* but what about rational and cumulative Science?

### Taking a Moment

Incommensurability is a feature of many disputes

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/kuhn/civil_war.jpg"
    alt="civil war"
    width="300" height="200"/>

Consider some controversial debate
 * Scientific: there’s long history
 * Non-scientific: politics, religion, sport, etc.

Can you identify some incommensurable points?
 * Talk at cross purposes - same words but different meaning
 * Contrasting interpretations of phenomena - same data but different conclusions

Perhaps these disputes are not resolvable by _rational_ argument alone

---

## A Couple of Incommensurable Examples

This way of characterising paradigms and incommesurabilitycan apply to groups and displutes inside and outside Science

In times of _crisis_ fixed concepts become fractured and controversial

Examples: 
 * A Non-Scientific Example: __Brexit__ ca. 2019 - Leave Vs Remain 
 * A Scientific Example: __Quantum Revolution__ ca. 1920s - Classical Physics Vs Copenhagen groups

### A Non-Scientific Example: Brexit

In times of _crisis_ fixed concepts become fractured and controversial

__Democratic Principle__: which votes should be respected
 * Leave: respect the referendum
 * Remain: illegitimate referendum as ill-informed and unclear

__Sovereignty of People__: where is The Will of the People?
 * Leave: Direct vote of referendum ca. 2016
 * Remain: Representative Parliament from general election ca. 2017

__Democratic Government__: who are the decision makers?
 * Leave: Executive Government (cabinet of major party)
 * Remain: Representative Parliament (all MPs)

Conventions become contentious and common understanding dissolves

The "_resolution_" of the controversy may not be a _rational_ argument


### A Physics Example

In times of _crisis_ fixed concepts become fractured and controversial

__Ontology__: what is the fundamental material of physics
 * Classical: point-like particles (simultaneous position and momentum)
 * Copenhagen: wave-particles (Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle)

__Explanatory power__: how to describe interactions
 * Classical: complete particle trajectory over space-time
 * Copenhagen: depends on experiment, not always possible (electrons and double slits)

__Accuracy__: precision of measurement/prediction
 * Classical: in principle infinite for individuals, though limited by apparatus
 * Copehagen: in principle limited, only possible for distributions

Conventions become contentious and common understanding dissolves

Kuhn's analysis posed serious problems to tradiational Philosophy of Science:
 * rationality - if revolutions are sponateous, how does Science develop rationally?
 * cumulative knowledge - how is knowledge preserved through theoretical leaps?
 * singular - although one paradigm emerges the winner, could another path be possible if the revolution was earlier/later?


### "Beyond Physics"?

In many debates there are implicit assumptions (quietly) at work

Sometimes "_natural_" assumptions are not even mentioned:
 * Every event has a cause
 * Material objects persist without observation
 * Nature is uniform – see part I
 * Natural properties are not time dependent – see part I

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/kuhn/captain_metaphysics.png"
    alt="captain metaphyics"
    width="200" height="200"/>

__Metaphysics__ is a part of the philosophy traditional which investigates assumptions that are implicit in cognitive models (a.k.a. theories of the world)

Not too popular in Philosophy of Science in early C20th 
 * Verificationists saw no place for _metaphysics_ in Science: what sort of knowledge is untestable?
 * Most Philosophers of Science were at least suspicious

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/kuhn/metaphysics_cartoon.png"
    alt="mid-twentieth century"
    width="300" height="200"/>

Kuhn's analysis entails metaphysics is an untestable __and__ indispensable part of any Paradigm


## Changing Studies of Science

The idea that Science consists of Paradigms and changes in important ways between Paradigms has consequences for investigations of Science

Investigate science as practiced now and in the past
 * Previous Paradigms: periods of “normal” science
 * Controversies: periods of dispute and revolution (Popper’s interest)

Sources in the present: use methods of Anthropology
 * Participants: researchers, reviewers, (non-)experts
 * Public Discussions: meetings, talks
 * Practices: tools and techniques

Sources in the past: use methods of History
 * Remaining participants 
 * Recorded documents (mainly textual)
 * Artefacts

In general, this is an empirical study of people and their ideas
 * Application of science to itself: a systematic study of systematic study

Likely you have been trained to think of Science as a history of (ever improving) ideas
 * A series of theories punctuated by crucial, decisive experiments
 * The scientist (often mid-aged white man) proposes and nature disposes
 * But when was the last time you saw that old white guy with the moustache and beard?

    width="500" height="200"/>

Is there an alternative way to consider science
 * Series of Paradigms and crises
 * Groups of scientists moving between world-views
 * You can see those guys are on TV and look them up on-line!
