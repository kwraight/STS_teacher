## Introduction

### Science in Action

We can’t start at the beginning or call a timeout on Science
 * So we have to investigate science as it works
Science has been around a while (and is associated with the _modern_ era)
 * history is important
Science is ongoing and developing
 * the current state is important (but probably not final)

### An important question?

Does the _who_ / _what_ / _why_ of Science matter?

| Attitude | Suggestion |
| --- | --- |
| Yes | __Welcome to STS!__ |
| No | Play along |
| Don't Care | Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride |

Here are some issues...

Politics:
 * Science has a position of _authority_ in society. 
     * Is it justified?

Economics:
 * Science costs money. Investment comes from governments and private companies. 
     * Does this affect the output?

Society:
 * Science affects all society. 
     * Should it seek _permission_, or _trust_ from (all) citizens?

Most other human endeavors do not have such high esteem
So you might ask: What makes Science special/different?

## Demarcation

The issue of separating science form non-science is known as the __Demarcation Problem__
_spoiler_: still a problem

The Demarcation Problem:
 * the separation of science from other activities

This related to an issue of _policing science_
 * what are the boundaries? - e.g. Astronomy in and Astrology out
 * who decides the boundaries?

Answers to Demarcation depend on your opinion of what Science does
 * Aims: truth, predictive accuracy, explanation, utility
 * Methods: induction, confirmation, falsification, paradigmatic eras, anarchy
 * Products: facts/knowledge, techniques, technology

In order to get to grips with the problem:
 * can we agree on some basic elements to Science?
 * can we find characteristics shared by (most) things called _Science_

## Common Characteristics?

Take your intuitively favourite set of scientific disciplines…

Are there _Necessary_ and _Sufficient_ conditions for science

| Condition | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Necessary | essential requirement |
| Sufficient | enough on its own |
| Equivalence | a necessary _and_ sufficient condition |
| Family Resemblance | overlapping groups without universal property |

Examples:
 * _Necessary Condition_:
     * e.g. Breaking eggs is a _necessary condition_ to make omelettes
     * Is there a property (set) of science that must be present?
     > $Science \Rightarrow X$
 * _Sufficient Condition_:
     * e.g. Smoke is a sufficient condition to conclude fire
     * Is there unique property (set) of science?
     > $X \Rightarrow Science$
 * _Equivalence Condition_:
     * e.g. A bachelor is an unmarried male
     * Is there a uniquely definitive property (set)?
     > $X \Leftrightarrow Science$
 * _Family Resemblence_:
     * e.g. \"game\" is not uniquely defined - many examples without _common_ characteristic
     * What are the overlapping of sets?

 Take a couple of minutes to consider basic properties of science
 * Is there a property (set) you consider crucial: necessary/sufficient
 * Is there a definitive property (set) you can define - equivalence
 * Is there nothing that covers all the intuitive cases

## Diversion

A brief detour for the purposes of analogy...

### A Sporting Analogy

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/preliminary/referee.png"
    alt="Referee"
    width="250" height="150"/>

Referees (_a.k.a._ umpires, etc.) have __ontological authority__
 * they decide matters - fair, foul, score, start & stop
This authority is based on __epistemic privilege__
 * some special characteristics that unique to referees
<!--

    alt="Eye-spy"
    width="350" height="200"/> -->

Features of _epistemic privilege_: what's special
 * Best position to decide - e.g. well-placed on the field
 * Impartial
 * Trained in interpretation

<img src="/Users/kwraight/repositories/STS_teacher/pictures/preliminary/umpire_action.png"
    alt="Reality maker"
    width="350" height="200"/>

Powers of _ontological authority_: deciding reality
 * Decide legitimate events: foul/fair
 * Decide quality of events: score/no score
 * Decide quantity of events: points

_Status_ from Authority: responsibility & recognition
 * Power – inside institution (game)
 * Respect – outside of institution (game)

__NB__ Authority is undermined when alternative privilege exists (e.g. instant replay!)

## Back to Science

Science has large amount of _ontological authority_ in society.
What is the _epistemic privilege_ of Science?

Back to the characteristics of Science

| What is Science like? | What is Science _not_ like? |
| --- | --- |
| Led by experience (_empirical_) | Innate/inherited knowledge (_Non-Empirical_) |
| Knowledge generating | No new knowledge |
| Testible - predictive | Approximate/vague | 
| Objective - unbiased | Subjective |
| Certain – strong inferences | Uncertain |
| Cumulative – built over centuries | Stagnant/decreasing |
| Stable – reliable knowledge | Chaotic |
| Rational – structure of inference | Irrational |

A key part in the _Common Sense_ image of science is the _empirical_ characteristic.
 * A focus on experience of _Nature_ is important...

The empirical element underlies several other characteristics of science:
 * Unbiased: Based on observed data, not innate prejudice
 * Objectivity: Based on public data, not subjective opinion
 * Culmuative: Based on growing dataset which improves (corrects) over time
 * Automnomous: Based on independent data, not external influences

The _empirical_ element justifies much of the _epistemic privilege_ and so _ontotlogical authority_
 > empirical element $\rightarrow$ epistemic privilege $\rightarrow$ ontological authority

<!-- __Empiricism__ is a (philosopical) theory of knowledge (_epistemology_) based on experience -->

Science records/collects experience
 * This is not particular to science - lots of activities use experience as a guide

Some process occurs to convert experience into knowledge
 * Theories are more than the list of events that have taken place

A common view is that science has a method for this
 * Is this method the special ingredient?

Past analyses of science see potential in this avenue for finding the unique ingredient to Science
